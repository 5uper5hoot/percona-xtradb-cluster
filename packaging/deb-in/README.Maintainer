TODO: Why /bin/bash for some files and /bin/sh for others (this is also the case in native packaging, so might be a reason)
TODO: Related to above: Should be POSIX compliant
TODO: Build with -DWITH_SYSTEMD and related to use inbuilt systemd support (Deb8 and Ubuntu15+)
TODO: Maybe refactor CMakeLists.txt to remove redundancy
TODO: Clean up install exception list so --list-missing can be changed to --fail-missing


###  WSREP stuff
TODO: Find a more effective way to configure just "packaging/deb-in/"
TODO: "control.in" is re-ordered like the one working in 5.7.11, for easier comparison.
      Re-order it back to Oracle sequence when finished, for easier maintenance.
TODO: Can we unite systemd files (service definition, pre- and post-scriptlets, maybe more) across platforms?
      In RedHat etc, we have "scripts/systemd/mysqld.service.in" which is working.
      Can we use that to replace "packaging/deb-in/mysql-packagesource-server-SERIES.mysql.service.in" ?
TODO: Check whether it was safe to drop "debian/additions/debian-start*", recover from old sources if not.
