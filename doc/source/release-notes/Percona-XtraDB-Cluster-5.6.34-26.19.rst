Fixed Bugs
==========

* PXC-252 / PXC-426 Optimized IST donor selection logic to avoid SST.
  Child processes are now cleaned-up and node state is resumed if SST fails.

* PXC-701 Added ``init.ok`` to the list of files that do not get removed during SST.

* PXC-703 Fixed error with ASIO library when building Galera.

* PXC-707 Fixed stalling of DML workload on slave node
  caused by ``FLUSH TABLE`` executed on master.

* PXC-713 Added ``encrypt=4`` mode for SST encryption
  that uses SSL files generated by MySQL.
  Modes ``1``, ``2``, and ``3`` will soon be deprecated.

* PXC-715 Fixed ``super_read_only`` to not apply to Galera replication applier.

* PXC-716 Redirected ``netcat`` output to ``stdout`` to avoid it in the log.

* PXC-717 ???

* PXC-720 Changed the :variable:`wsrep_max_ws_rows` variable
  to ignore non-replicated write-sets generated by DML action
  on temporary tables (explict or implicit).

* PXC-722 Fixed SST to fail with an error if SSL is not supported by ``socat``,
  instead of switching to unencrypted mode.

* PXC-723 Fixed SST with SSL to auto-generate a 2048-bit :file:`dhparams` file
  for versions of ``socat`` before 1.7.3.
  These older versions use 512-bit :file:`dhparams` file by default
  that get rejected by newer clients with ``dh key too small`` error.

* PXC-731 Changed the :variable:`wsrep_cluster_name` variable to read-only,
  because changing it dynamically leads to high overhead.

* PXC-732 Improved error message when any of the SSL files required for SST
  are missing.

* PXC-735 Fixed SST to fail with an error when ``netcat`` is used
  (:option:`transferfmt` set to ``nc``) with SSL encryption
  (:option:`encrypt` set to ``2``, ``3`` or ``4``),
  instead of silently switching to unencrypted mode.
